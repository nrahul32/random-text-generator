# Random Text Generator

This is an application built using React to generate random text.

It uses the API "https://baconipsum.com/api/" to get the text. This API takes number of paragraphs and format(html/text) as parameters to provide the text.

These 2 parameters are collected from the user via the components: Paragraph and Format

Everytime the user selects these, a call to API will be triggered and the obtained text will be displayed to the user via the Output component.

The 3 components used are present in src/components folder.
